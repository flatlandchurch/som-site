Omaha School of Ministry offers a robust, Biblically-centered education alongside hands-on ministry experience. Students can pick from a number of ministry tracks and work beside proven Christian leaders who practice real ministry every single day.

Omaha School of Ministry is operated by Flatland Church, which is all about helping people move to the center of God's Kingdom, where we believe real life transformation happens. Not only is OSM an opportunity to move closer to God, its an opportunity to learn the tools and skills to help other people move closer to Him as well.

Flatland Church belongs to a cooperative fellowship of churches called the Assemblies of God, which holds to a set of [16 fundamental truths](/doctrines). While we welcome students of a variety of Christian traditions, we think its important that students understand our distinctives, as it informs much of the way we operate as a church.
