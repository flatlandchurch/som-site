Picking a school is hard to do without seeing the campus and meeting the teachers and staff. We want to offer you the same opportunity. Fill out the form below and let us know you'd like to come visit our campus. You'll meet with Mitchell McNaney, the head of Omaha School of Ministry, as well as Flatland Church's lead pastor, Bart Wilkins. 

While you're waiting to set up a time, we'd encourage you to [checkout a few of the past sermons](https://flatlandchurch.com/watch) from Flatland Church, to get a feel for what our Sunday mornings look like.
