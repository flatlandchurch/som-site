testimony:
    name: Elijah H. (2019 student)
    content: Another amazing part of this internship is that the staff treat you as an equal. They expect you to be responsible and hardworking, but they also offer grace when you fall short. This program has been the greatest blessing that I have received in the last 9 months. I wouldn’t have wanted to spend it anywhere else. I’m grateful to God for the chance to work with these people and that I love doing the ministry God has called me to.
